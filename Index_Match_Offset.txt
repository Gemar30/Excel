Syntax
Purpose - Get the position of an array

= match (look_up value, look_up_array, [Match_type])

Arguments 
look_up_value - The value to match in look_up array.
look_up_array - A range of cells or an array reference 
Match_type - 1 = exact or next smallest (default) and look_up_array must be sorted in ascending order. largest value <= look_up_value
            0 = exact match and look_up_array does not need to be sorted.
            -1 exact or next largest and look_up_array must be sorted in desc order.

Notes:

- Match returns the N/A error if no match is found
- In case of duplicated match returns the first match


Excel Index Function
- returns the value at a given position in a range or array.

= index(array, row_num, col_num)

location = match
value = Index

Vlook up - Left to right
Index - right to left / left to right

Offset function - volatile function

=Offset(reference, rows, columns, [height], [width])

-Offset(start in this cell, go up/down a no. of rows, go left/right a no. of columns, height of range, width of range)

negative cols = left 
negative rows = above

few scenarios using Offset

- Get the sum or average of the last 7 transaction
- return the last value in a columns
- Look up two values in a table
- Create dynamic ranges that will be used in a chart
- Calculate moving averages.
